The structure of this study is organized as follows: 

	Within the GRU folder, there are experiments conducted using the GRU algorithm, 
	LSTM folder , there are experiments conducted using the LSTM algorithm,
        Results folder includes results of the each experiments.

Each experiment saved as a separate .py file. Thus, each .py file contains only minor modifications from the others. 
The names of these .py files indicate the specific experiments they contain, with numbers in the filenames representing the sequence of the experiments. 

The original code for this study is located under the GRU folder "GRU-MS-SMF_1500K_0601_Adam_Image.py" 

As a result of the experiments, .txt files prefixed with accuracy_logs have been generated, storing values obtained for each epoch and fold.
